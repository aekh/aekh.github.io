My current position mainly focuses on combining optimisation and data science for statistical post-election audits and other work surrounding elections and election integrity.

Research interests include:

 * Interdisciplinary research with real-world impact
 * Constraint-based optimisation modelling.
 * Combinatorial/discrete optimisation, and automated planning and scheduling.
 * Operations research/analytics, applied mathematics, and decision science.
 * Online/dynamic/real-time optimisation and robust/stochastic optimization.
 * Statistics, data science, and machine learning.
 * Constraint programming, and other solving technology.
 * Logistics, supply chain management, energy systems, vehicle routing, rostering, and scheduling.
 * Economics, fair division, fair resource allocation, and social choice theory.
 * Game theory, and bargaining theory
 * Election auditing, and election security
 * Mixed-integer-continous-discrete optimisation, including non-convex optimisation.
